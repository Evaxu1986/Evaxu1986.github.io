	  <p>Project Review:      </p>
	  <p>ClassIn, a professional online classroom software created in Beijing, China. ClassIn is not the internet-based “minimalist and easy to use” but the pursuit of teaching “professional”, which will bring teachers extraordinary teaching experience.
	    Problems that hamper teachers in Efei Education Institutes vary from no relevant ClassIn training courses to teach teachers to use the software to teachers’ lack of time to participate in trainings for a long period of time.
	    The Capstone Project turns to microlearning to divide the trainings on ClassIn into several parts and make learners easier to absorb in the information. Due to various functions, the project aims to the foundation part. The goal of the project is to make most teachers in Efei Education Institutes to be in command of teaching on ClassIn online classroom in creative and constructive ways.
