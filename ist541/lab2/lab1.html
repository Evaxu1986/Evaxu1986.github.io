           <p>Either keep the specimens moist until you’re ready to press them, or press shortly after picking them. Fold the specimen inside a few sheets of newspaper to absorb the moisture, using additional paper for larger specimens. If you have blotting paper, fold that outside of the newspaper.</p>
           <p>Collect a good specimen - all the parts needed for accurate identification. Because you probably do not know what these are, collect as many different parts of the plant as possible - leaves, flowers, twigs, fruit, seeds. For small herbaceous plants, collect the roots and either whole stems or tops and bottoms (leaf shape, size, and arrangement may vary from top to bottom).</p>

      Please take care when you pick up specimens: 
	  1.The specimen is obtained from plants with suspected infection.
	  2.Exposure to the specimen could result in an infection.
      3.The specimen is collected during an investigation of an outbreak of a serious disease of unknown cause.

			<p>You can use a wooden, gridded plant press, which allows air to circulate and dry the specimens evenly. If you don&rsquo;t have a plant press, you can use extra pieces of cardboard or plain pieces of wood. Starting with the layer of wood on the bottom, begin alternating cardboard, blotting paper, and then the specimen in newspaper followed by more blotting paper. You can add multiple plant specimens to the same &ldquo;cake,&rdquo; as long as you keep alternating layers! </p>

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p>You will probably want to make your specimens look nice and last well so you will need to mount your specimens.</p>
			<p>Use glue, sticky tape or a needle and thread to attach each specimen to a clean sheet of thin cardboard or heavy mounting paper.</p>
			<p>If you use standard sized paper you can store them in a loose-leaf binder for easy access.</p>
			<p>The dried plant will be brittle so if it is properly dried, put your mounted specimen in a plastic or paper cover if you will be handling it often, or if it is to go on display.</p>
			<p> Large herbaria need to ensure that their specimens will last for hundreds of years so they must use acid-free paper and special glues and inks that do not deteriorate.</p>
